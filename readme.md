# The Invisible Board Game - Board Generation
Board generation done with TypeScript, because doing it in Godot would lead to (even more) headaches.

You can either run it locally or go to [`https://www.mauritswilke.com/IBG`](https://www.mauritswilke.com/IBG), although it needs to manually be updated and probably is out-of-sync already.
